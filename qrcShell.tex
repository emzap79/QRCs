\section{Movements}{\metakeydef}
\cmdS{\ctrl a\ \ctrl e}{jump to begin,  end of the line}

\cmdS{\ctrl f\ \ctrl b}{move one $char$ forward, backward}
\cmdS{\meta f\ \meta b}{jump one word forward, backward}
\cmdS{\meta $\leftarrow$\or \ctrl w}{cut text backward until space}
\cmdS{\meta d}{cut one word forward until space}
\cmdS{\ctrl y}{paste most recently cut out text}

\section{History}{Prompt all executed history events: {\tt history}, clear
entire history event cache: {\tt history -c}}
\subsection{Shortcuts}{}
\cmdS{\ctrl p}{fetch the previous command from the history list}
\cmdS{\meta .\ \ }{print last argument(s) to line}
\cmdS{\ctrl r\ \ctrl s}{search history backward, forward (incremental search)}
\cmdS{\meta p~\meta n}{search backward, forward using non-incre\-mental search}
\cmdS{\meta $<$~\meta $>$}	{move to the first, last line in history}
% \cmdS{\ctrl n}{fetch the next command from the history list}
% \cmdS{\ctrl r}{search history backward for a command matching \it{string}}
% \cmdS{\ctrl s}{search history forward (incremental search)}
% \cmdS{\ctrl s}{search history forward for a command matching \it{string}}
% \cmdS{k}{fetch the previous command from the history list}
% \cmdS{j}{fetch the next command from the history list}
% \cmdS{n}{repeat search in the same direction as previous}
% \cmdS{N}{repeat search in the opposite direction as previous}
% \cmdS{G}{move to the N-th history line}
% \cmdExample{15G}{move to $15$th line}

\subsection{History-Commands}{Example command is: {\tt cd foo/bar}}
\cmdS{!!}{runs previous executed command (also known as `bang bang')}
\cmdExmpl{sudo cd foo/bar}{sudo\ !!}
\cmdS{!\$}{repeats last $arg$ of prev command}
\cmdS{!$n$\ !-$n$}{executes command $n$, last $n$th command}
\cmdS{!$str$\ !?$str$?}{runs last executed command starting with, containing $str$}
\cmdExmpl{cd foo/bar}{!cd}
% \cmdExmpl{sudo cd foo/bar}{!?sudo?}
\cmdS{!!:$opt$}{filter last command by designators\or modifiers}
\cmdExmpl{echo 'cd foo/bar'}{echo !cd:q}
\cmdS{!\#}{entire command line typed so far}
\cmdL{!!:gs/old/new/}{substitutes new for old}
\cmdExmpl{\^{}$str_1$\^{}$str_2$ ($\Rightarrow$ \^{} literally)}{quick substitution, replacing $str_1$ with $str_2$}

\subsection{Options}{you may append as many options as you want, e.~g. you
could do a: $!!:\$:p$ (prints least argument of last executed history command)}
\subsubsection{Event Designators}{}
\cmdOper{0}{the first word in a line (usually command\or programs name)}
\cmdOper{n}{the $n$th word in a line}
\cmdOper{\^{}}{the first $arg$ (the second word) in a line}
\cmdOper{$\$$}{the last argument $arg$ in a line}
\cmdOper{\%}{the word $str$ matched by the most recent !?$str$? search}
\cmdOper{$m$-$n$}{a range of words from $m$ to $n$ (-$n$ is synonymous with 0-$n$)}
\cmdOper{*}{all $arg$'s}
\cmdOper{$m$*}{synonymous with $m$-\$}
\cmdOper{$m$-}{from $arg$ $m$ to end, ommitting last word}

\subsubsection{Event Modifiers}{}
% http://www.softpanorama.org/Scripting/Shellorama/bash_command_history_reuse.shtml#Modifiers
\cmdOper{h}{removes a trailing pathname component, leaving the head}
\cmdOper{t}{removes all leading pathname components, leaving the tail (filename in path)}
\cmdOper{r}{removes a trailing suffix of the form .xxx, leaving the basename}
\cmdOper{e}{removes all but the trailing suffix}
\cmdOper{p}{prints the resulting command but does not execute it}
\cmdOper{q}{quotes the substituted words, escaping further substitutions}
\cmdOper{m}{quotes the substituted words, breaking them into words at blanks and newlines}
\cmdOper{\&}{repeats the previous substitution}
\cmdOper{g}{causes s/old/new/ or \& to be applied over the entire event line}
\cmdOper{G}{apply the following `s' modifier just once to each word in the event line.}

% \section{Other Commands}{}
\section{Special Commands}{}
\cmdS{\ctrl s~\ctrl c~\ctrl q}{pause,  cancel, resume current process}
\cmdS{popd}	{switch to last saved $dir$ from index}
\cmdS{pushd $dir$}	{save $dir$ to index}   % http://www.linuxuser.co.uk/tutorials/14-command-line-tips-tricks
\cmdS{\ctrl X\ctrl E}	{work on line under cursor in default EDITOR and execute it afterwards}
\cmdS{\ctrl \#}{prepend hash to command, then jump to next line (... and reedit later)}
% \subsection{Basic Operations}{}
% \cmdS{cd $path$}{change directory}
% \subsubsection{possible values for $path$}{}
% \cmdOper{..}{move one folder up}
% \cmdOper{--}{change to last visited directory}
% \cmdOper{\key{None}}{change to homedir ($\sim$)}
% \cmdS{mkdir $dir$}{create new $dir$ectory in (current) path}

% \section{Bashrc}{The prompt of your {\tt shell} can be adjusted throug changing {\tt PS1=<expr>} in your {\tt \tild.bashrc}}
% \subsection{History Modifying Settings}{Append {\tt export <setting>=<value>} to your$\,\sim$/.bashrc}
% \cmdS{HISTFILE}{if set to /dev/null history file is rejected (Default:$\,\sim$/.bash\_history)}
% \cmdL{HISTFILESIZE}{controls how many history commands to keep in HISTFILE (Default: 500)}
% \cmdS{HISTSIZE}{controls how many history commands to keep in the history list of current session (Default: 500)}
% \cmdL{HISTCONTROL}{modality of how to save commands on the history list.}
% \cmdOptLl{ignorespace}{if the list of values includes ignorespace, lines which begin with a space character are not saved in the history list.}
% \cmdOptLl{ignoredups}{a value of ignoredups causes lines matching the previous history  entry  to  not  be saved.}
% \cmdOptLl{ignoreboth}{a value of ignoreboth is shorthand for ignorespace and ignoredups.}
% \cmdOptLl{erasedups}{a value of erasedups causes all previous lines matching the current line to be removed from the history list before that line is saved.}
% \cmdL{HISTIGNORE}{controls which commands to ignore and not save to the history list.}
% 
% \subsection{Shopt Option}{Shopt options can be set by a {\tt shopt -s option} and can be unset by a {\tt shopt -u option} shell com\-mand.}
% \cmdS{histappend}{setting the variable appends current session history to HISTFILE. Unsetting overwrites the file each time}
% \cmdS{histreedit}{if set, puts a failed history substitution back on the command line for re-editing}
% \cmdS{histverify}{if set, puts the command to be executed after a substitution on command line as if you had typed it}
