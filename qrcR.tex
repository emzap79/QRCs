        header=T} to read the first line as a header of column names; use {\tt
        as.is=T} to prevent character vectors from being converted to factors;\\
    use {\tt comment.char=""} to prevent {\tt "\#"} from being interpreted as a
    comment; use {\tt skip=n} to skip {\tt n} lines before reading data; see

    use {\tt col.names=NA} to add a blank column header to get the
    column headers aligned correctly for spreadsheet input}
\cmdL{sink(file)}	{[output to {\tt file}, until {\tt sink()}] Most
    of the I/O functions have a {\tt file} argument. This can often be a
    character string naming a file or a connection.  {\tt file=""} means
    the standard input or output. Connections can include files, pipes,

{\tt x <- read.delim("clipboard")}\\
To write a table to the clipboard for Excel, use \\
{\smalltt write.table(x,"clipboard",sep="\bs t", col.names=NA)}

\section{Graphical parameters}{}

These can be set globally with
{\tt par(...)}; many can be passed as
parameters to plotting commands.


\cmdL{adj}	{controls text justification ({\tt 0} left-justified, {\tt 0.5} centred, {\tt 1} right-justified)}

\cmdL{bty}	{controls the type of box drawn around the plot, allowed values are: {\tt "o"}, {\tt "l"}, {\tt "7"}, {\tt "c"}, {\tt "u"} ou {\tt "]"} (the box looks like the corresponding character); if {\tt bty="n"} the box is not drawn}
\cmdL{cex}	{ a value controlling the size of texts and symbols with respect to the default; the following parameters have the same control for numbers on the axes, {\tt cex.axis}, the axis labels, {\tt cex.lab}, the title, {\tt cex.main}, and the sub-title, {\tt cex.sub}}
\cmdL{col}	{controls the color of symbols and lines; use color names: {\tt "red"}, {\tt "blue"} see {\tt colors()} or as {\tt "\#RRGGBB"}; see {\tt rgb()}, {\tt hsv()}, {\tt gray()}, and {\tt rainbow()}; as for {\tt cex} there are: {\tt col.axis}, {\tt col.lab}, {\tt col.main}, {\tt col.sub}}
\cmdL{font}	{an integer which controls the style of text ({\tt 1}: normal, {\tt 2}: italics, {\tt 3}: bold, {\tt 4}: bold italics); as for {\tt cex} there are: {\tt font.axis}, {\tt font.lab}, {\tt font.main}, {\tt font.sub}}

\cmdL{lwd}	{ a numeric which controls the width of lines, default {\tt 1}}
\cmdL{mar}	{ a vector of 4 numeric values which control the space between the axes and the border of the graph of the form {\tt c(bottom, left, top, right)}, the default values are {\tt c(5.1, 4.1, 4.1, 2.1)}}
\cmdL{mfcol}	{a vector of the form {\tt c(nr,nc)} which partitions the graphic window as a matrix of {\tt nr} lines and {\tt nc} columns, the plots are then drawn in columns}
\cmdL{mfrow}	{ id. but the plots are drawn by row}
\cmdL{pch}	{ controls the type of symbol, either an integer between 1 and 25, or any single character within {\tt ""}}
% \samepage\includegraphics[width=8.5cm]{pch_symbol}
% \samepage\includegraphics[draft]{pch_symbol}

\cmdL{ps}	{ an integer which controls the size in points of texts and symbols}
\cmdL{pty}	{ a character which specifies the type of the plotting region, {\tt "s"}: square, {\tt "m"}: maximal}
\cmdL{tck}	{a value which specifies the length of tick-marks on the axes as a fraction of the smallest of the width or height of the plot; if {\tt tck=1} a grid is drawn}

\cmdL{yaxt}	{if {\tt yaxt="n"} the $y$-axis is set but not drawn (useful in conjonction with {\tt axis(side=2, ...)})}
\section{Lattice (Trellis) graphics}{}

\cmdL{xyplot(y\~{}x)}	{ bivariate plots (with many functionalities)}
\cmdL{barchart(y\~{}x)}	{  histogram of the values of {\tt y} with respect to those of {\tt x}}
\cmdL{dotplot(y\~{}x)}	{ Cleveland dot plot (stacked plots line-by-line and column-by-column)}
\cmdL{densityplot(\~{}x)}	{ density functions plot}
\cmdL{histogram(\~{}x)}	{ histogram of the frequencies of {\tt x}}
\cmdL{bwplot(y\~{}x)}	{ ``box-and-whiskers'' plot}
\cmdL{qqmath(\~{}x)}	{  quantiles of {\tt x} with respect to the values expected under a theoretical distribution}

\cmdL{stripplot(y\~{}x)}	{  single dimension plot, {\tt x} must be numeric, {\tt y} may be a factor}
\cmdL{qq(y\~{}x)}	{quantiles to compare two distributions, {\tt x} must be numeric, {\tt y} may be numeric, character, or factor but must have two `levels'}
\cmdL{splom(\~{}x)}	{ matrix of bivariate plots}
\cmdL{parallel(\~{}x)}	{ parallel coordinates plot}
\cmdL{levelplot(z\~{}x*y|g1*g2)}	{coloured plot of the values of {\tt z} at the coordinates given by {\tt x} and {\tt y} ({\tt x}, {\tt y} and {\tt z} are all of the same length)}
\cmdL{wireframe(z\~{}x*y|g1*g2)}	{ 3d surface plot}
\cmdL{cloud(z\~{}x*y|g1*g2)}	{ 3d scatter plot}
In the normal Lattice formula, {\tt y~x|g1*g2} has
combinations of optional conditioning variables {\tt g1}
and {\tt g2} plotted on separate panels. Lattice functions
take many of the same arguments as base
graphics plus also {\tt data=} the data frame for the formula
variables and {\tt subset=} for subsetting. Use {\tt panel=} to
define a custom panel function (see {\tt apropos("panel")}
and {\tt ?llines}). Lattice functions return an object of class
trellis and have to be {\tt print}-ed to produce the graph. Use
{\tt print(xyplot(...))} inside functions where automatic
printing doesn't work. Use {\tt lattice.theme} and {\tt lset} to
change Lattice defaults.
