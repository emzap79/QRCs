# QRCs

This is a collection of my quick reference cards on diverse code and linux
related terminal commands. If copied, I provided a quick notice at the end of
the file, where it's originally been taken from.

## Content

My repo contains qrc's of the following issues

- Bash
- R
- GIT
- TIG
- Tmux
- VIM

## Create PDF

Compile them via: `pdftex qrc.tex` or use the included Makefile. Therefore change
into directory where the QRC is located and type `make <name>` eg. `make vim`.
This will compile the tex-file, showing the result in a pdf-reader of your
choice; please feel free to contact me or sending me pull-requests!
